Project clawler aims to 
provide sorted expansion rate(AKA ROI) of each stock laid in following countries using python or perl to fetch data on internet.
  - Taiwan
  - China
  - America

Deployed PyCharm to develop modules and packages.
Plug-in Code-With-Me allows real time coding collaboratively.

MiniConda (or AnaConda if you don't mine disk size) is a MUST for self study on jupyter/IPython case.
In some cases, some module like pandas can't be installed or run into trouble, you probably need Conda.
